# School Project - built using Node.js

Description: My Final Project will be a website about art. It will have a login page so that there can be various different users.  A page that allows a user to play some sort of game. A page that uses a
form submission and a page that displays artwork.

Schemas: There will be a schema for an art show that will be booked. A schema for a user comment made on an art
        show, and a schema for a user that logs in to the website and an additional schema for comments made outside
        of the art shows.

Concepts to be researched: For this project, I will research Jasmine for testing javascript code for the game that will
                          be made, JSHint for checking errors, CSS 3 with different effects, SASS for enhanced css coding
                          and I will implement authentication and user login.
